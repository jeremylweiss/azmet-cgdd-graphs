# azmet-cgdd-graphs
R project to create time series graphs of cumulative growing degree days for meteorological stations in the University of Arizona - Arizona Meteorological (AZMET) network.

A variable that helps us understand and predict the timing of plant and insect growth stages is the accumulation of heat during the year, often quantified by the sum of growing degree days, that is, cumulative growing degree days (CGDDs).
