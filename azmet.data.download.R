#  This function downloads daily AZMET data for an individual station, 
#  formats the data into a dataframe, performs a quality check to
#  ensure that there are no missing or duplicate dates or other
#  oddities, and writes the station data dataframe to the current
#  environment.


#####  START THE FUNCTION


azmet.data.download <- function( stn_name ) {
  
  
  #####  SETUP 
  
  
  #  AZMET data format changes between the periods 1987-2002 and
  #  2003-present, as the number of variables measured / reported
  #  and their order in the data file are slightly different. We
  #  will set up a column name string that matches the variables
  #  and variable order of the latter period.
  
  #  Set column name string for the 2003-present period. This list
  #  can be found at http://ag.arizona.edu/azmet/raw2003.htm. Note
  #  that the soil temperature depths change between the 1987-2002
  #  and 2003-present periods. We use the depths from the latter to
  #  name these columns instead of generating new columns for the
  #  different depths between the two periods. As we do not anticipate
  #  using soil temperature data, this is of no consequence. However, 
  #  this code will need to be changed in order to address this issue
  #  if soil temperature data becomes of interest. Soil temperature
  #  sensor depth was actually changed in 1999. 
  col_names <- c( "year","doy","stn_no","Tmax","Tmin","Tmean",
                  "RHmax","RHmin","RHmean","VPDmean","SORADtot","PRCtot",
                  "4STmax","4STmin","4STmean","20STmax","20STmin","20STmean",
                  "WSmean","WVmag","WVdir","Wdirstd","WSmax","HU8555","ETref",
                  "ETrefPM","AVPmean","DPTmean" )
  
  #  Set the string elements that together will build the full
  #  URL where individual AZMET station data reside. Note that 
  #  daily station data are available by individual years.
  
  #  Extract the row of information (station name, station number,
  #  start year, and end year) tied to the selected AZMET station.
  stn_info <- subset( x = stn_list,
                      subset = stn == stn_name )
  
  #  Set the station number based on the information extracted from
  #  'stn_list' in the previous command. The station number will 
  #  need to be converted to a character string in order to be put
  #  together with the other full URL string elements. Also, if the
  #  station number is less than 10, the station number character
  #  string will need to have a '0' preceeding it, in order to match
  #  the AZMET daily data file name format.
  stn_no <- as.character( select( stn_info,stn_no ) )

  }
  
  #  Set the range of years for which to download data for the
  #  selected station. Although we set the variable 'stn_yrs' as an
  #  integer here, we will pull the last two digits of individual
  #  years as a string later in this code.
  stn_yrs <- as.integer( select( stn_info,start_yr ) ):as.integer( select( stn_info,end_yr ) )
  
  #  Set the base URL of the AZMET data.
  baseurl <- "http://ag.arizona.edu/azmet/data/"
  
  #  Set the suffix of the data file to be downloaded.
  suffix <- "rd.txt"
  
  
  #####  DOWNLOAD DATA
  
  
  #  Recall that AZMET data are provided year-by-year. This means
  #  that we will need to iteratively download the annual files.
  
  #  Loop through the 'stn_yrs' integer vector in order to build the
  #  full URL where the AZMET daily data for individual years reside.
  #  We will treat the 1987-2002 and 2003-present periods differently
  #  within the loop.
  for ( i in 1:length( stn_yrs ) ) {
    
    #  Set the data URL.
    url <- paste0( baseurl,
                   stn_no,
                   substr( as.character( stn_yrs[ i ] ),3,4 ),
                   suffix )
    
    #  Test for the condition of a year falling in the 1987-2002
    #  period. If true, switch the last two columns and add three
    #  new empty columns after the existing columns that will contain
    #  new variables that start in 2003. These changes are described
    #  at http://ag.arizona.edu/azmet/raw2003.htm.
    if ( stn_yrs[ i ] <= 2002 ) {
      stn_data <- read.table( url,
                              header = FALSE,
                              sep=',',
                              fill = TRUE )
      stn_data <- stn_data[ c( 1:23,25,24 ) ]
      stn_data[ ,26:28 ] <- NA
    }
    
    #  If the year falls in the 2003-present period instead, simply
    #  read in the data as is.
    else {
      stn_data <- read.table( url,
                              header = FALSE,

    }
    
    #  Years prior to 2000 appear to be two-digit values instead
    #  of four-digit values. Overwrite the first column for all years
    #  with four-digit values just to make sure that this issue is
    #  resolved. Doing this also helps with a QC issue in which the
    #  'year' is wrong for a couple of DOYs.
    stn_data[ ,1 ] <- rep( stn_yrs[ i ],
                           nrow( stn_data ) )
    
    #  Concatenate the data in the row dimension as it is 
    #  downloaded year-by-year.
    if( i == 1 ) {
      stn_data2 <- stn_data
    }
    else {
      stn_data2 <- rbind( stn_data2,stn_data )
    }
  }
  stn_data <- stn_data2
  rm( i,stn_data2 )
  
  
  #####  FORMAT DATA
  
  
  #  Set the column names for the downloaded data.
  colnames( stn_data ) <- col_names
  
  #  For data summaries, it may be useful to have the 'date', 
  #  'month' and 'day' corresponding to the existing 'year' and
  #  'doy'. Create these former vectors and add them to the 
  #  'stn_data' data frame.
  date <- as.Date.character( paste( stn_data$year,
                                    stn_data$doy ),
                             format="%Y %j" )
  year <- as.numeric( format( date,"%Y" ) )
  month <- as.numeric( format( date,"%m" ) )
  day <- as.numeric( format( date,"%d" ) )
  stn_data <- cbind( date,year,month,day,stn_data[ ,2:28 ] )
  
  rm( date,day,month,year )
  
  #  Based on previous work with AZMET data, there are several known
  #  formatting bugs in the original / downloaded data files. We will
  #  address these individually below.
  
  #  An odd character (".") appears at the end of some data files for 
  #  some years and some stations. In the R dataframe, this results
  #  in a row of NAs. Find and remove these rows.
  stn_data <- stn_data[ rowSums( is.na( stn_data ) ) != ncol( stn_data ), ]
  
  #  Replace 'nodata' values in the downloaded AZMET data with 'NA'.
  #  Values for 'nodata' in AZMET data are designated as '999'.
  #  However, other similar values also appear (e.g., 999.9).
  stn_data[ stn_data == 999 ] <- NA
  stn_data[ stn_data == 999.9 ] <- NA
  stn_data[ stn_data == 9999 ] <- NA
  
  #  Some AZMET data files have duplicate row entries. Find and
  #  remove these rows.
  stn_data <- distinct( stn_data )
  
  
  ##### ADDRESS MISSING VALUES
  
  
  #  Create a dataframe that mimics the actual station data, but
  #  has a full YYYYMMDD list. AZMET data can have missing date
  #  entries.
  
  #  Create a new object that fully expands dates between the 
  #  first and last dates in the station data. 
  date_full <- seq( first( stn_data$date ),last( stn_data$date ),by="days" )
  
  #  Convert this new object to a dataframe that will allow us to
  #  join with the station data. Dataframe column names must match
  #  the column names in the station data in order to join.
  stn_data_full <- data.frame( matrix( NA,
                                       nrow=length( date_full ) ) )
  colnames( stn_data_full ) <- "date"
  stn_data_full$date <- date_full
  
  #  Join the complete dates dataframe with the station data by
  #  using 'date' as the key.
  stn_data_full <- left_join( stn_data_full,
                              stn_data,
                              by="date" )
  
  stn_data <- as_tibble( stn_data_full )
  rm( stn_data_full )
  
  #  Fill in values for year, month, day, and day-of-year for any
  #  date entries that may be missing in the downloaded original 
  #  data.
  stn_data$year <- as.numeric( format( stn_data$date,"%Y" ) )
  stn_data$month <- as.numeric( format( stn_data$date,"%m" ) )
  stn_data$day <- as.numeric( format( stn_data$date,"%d" ) )
  stn_data$doy <- as.numeric( format( stn_data$date,"%j" ) )
  
  #  Do similarly with the station number value.
  stn_data$stn_no <- stn_info$stn_no
